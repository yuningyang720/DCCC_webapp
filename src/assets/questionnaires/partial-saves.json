If you find yourself having judgmental thoughts, notice them and then let them go.    Now just inhale, count to 6 in your head, and then slowly exhale. As you breathe in, feel the air in your nose, feel your lungs expand, feel the change in your diaphragm. As you breathe out, let your thoughts go as well.",
